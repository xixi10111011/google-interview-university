# comments after watching "The myth of the Genius Programmer"

1. the real genius is quite few in this world, the rest of us are somehow on the same level.

    Do not try to pretend to be a genius if not a real one.
    It is not shame to admit that I'm not a genius.

2. collaboration.

    Since I'm not a genius, I need to collaborate with others if I want to be successful.

3. bus factor

    bus factor is a metaphor that the probability of project failure if some guy in your team got hit by a bus.
    This means that each modular or component needs to have backup HR.

4. code review

    code review is necessary for better code quality.
    It is also a good way to reduce bus factor.

5. criticism

    Provide constructive criticism.
    be able to deal with both constructive and non-constructive criticism.

6. be a small scared fish

    if you are a big comfortable fish, then it is quite hard to learn things.
    find a way to be a small scared fish in your pond.
